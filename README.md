# Social Network Ads Prediction with XAI
# Overview
This project involves using a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether users will purchase a product based on their demographic data. The dataset includes features like age, gender, and estimated salary. To enhance the transparency of the model, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are applied using the ELI5 library. This helps in understanding the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.

# Explainable AI (XAI) with ELI5
The ELI5 library was used to explain the model's weights and individual predictions. This included:

Feature Importance: Identifying the most influential features in the model.
Prediction Explanation: Providing detailed explanations for specific predictions, including the contribution of each feature to the predicted outcome.

# Steps
Load the python file upload the attached dataset and get a clear explanation of why the model is predicting it and through a flowchart we can see why that particular prediction was made. 
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to integrate XAI techniques with traditional machine learning models to enhance interpretability. The use of ELI5 provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of the model, which can be crucial for understanding, debugging, and improving model performance.
